- In which the majority of each line operates in a separated right-of-way dedicated for public transportation use during peak periods; and 
- That includes features that emulate the services provided by rail fixed guideway public transportation systems, including: 
   o Defined stations 
   o Traffic signal priority for public transportation vehicles 
   o Short headway bidirectional services for a substantial part of weekdays and weekend days 
   o Pre-board ticketing, platform level boarding, and separate branding 
This mode may include portions of service that are fixed-guideway and non-fixed-guideway."

This service may operate motorcoaches (aka over-the-road buses), and usually features peak scheduling, multiple-trip tickets, and limited stops in the central city."
Commuter Rail (CR),,"A transit mode that is an electric or diesel propelled railway for urban passenger train service consisting of local short distance travel operating between a central city and adjacent suburbs. Service must be operated on a regular basis by or under contract with a transit operator for the purpose of transporting passengers within urbanized areas (UZAs), or between urbanized areas and outlying areas. 
Such rail service, using either locomotive hauled or self-propelled railroad passenger cars, is generally characterized by: 
- Multi-trip tickets 
- Specific station to station fares 
- Railroad employment practices 
- Usually only one or two stations in the central business district 
It does not include: 
- Heavy rail (HR) rapid transit 
- Light rail (LR)/streetcar transit service 
Intercity rail service is excluded, except for that portion of such service that is operated by or under contract with a public transit agency for predominantly commuter services. Predominantly commuter service means that for any given trip segment (i.e., distance between any two stations), more than 50 percent of the average daily ridership makes a return trip on the same day. Only the predominantly commuter service portion of an intercity route is eligible for inclusion when determining commuter rail (CR) route miles."
Demand Response (DR),,"A transit mode comprised of automobiles, vans or small buses operating in response to calls from passengers or their agents to the transit operator, who then dispatches a vehicle to pick up the passengers and transport them to their destinations.

- The vehicles do not operate over a fixed route or on a fixed schedule except, perhaps, on a temporary basis to satisfy a special need; and 
- Typically, the vehicle may be dispatched to pick up several passengers at different pick-up points before taking them to their respective destinations and may even be interrupted en route to these destinations to pick up other passengers. 
The following types of operations fall under the above definitions provided they are not on a scheduled fixed route basis: 
- Many origins—many destinations 
- Many origins—one destination 
- One origin—many destinations 
- One origin—one destination"

Intercity ferryboat (FB) service is excluded, except for that portion of such service that is operated by or under contract with a public transit agency for predominantly commuter services. Predominantly commuter service means that for any given trip segment (i.e., distance between any two piers), more than 50 percent of the average daily ridership makes a return trip on the ferryboat on the same day. Only the predominantly commuter service portion of an intercity route is eligible for inclusion when determining ferryboat (FB) route miles."

- Sophisticated signaling 
- Raised platform loading"
Hybrid Rail (YR),,"Rail systems primarily operating routes on the National system of railroads, but not operating with the characteristics of commuter rail. This service typically operates light rail-type vehicles as diesel multipleunit trains (DMU’s). These trains do not meet Federal Railroad Administration standards, and so must operate with temporal separation from freight rail traffic."
Inclined Plane (IP),,A transit mode that is a railway operating over exclusive right-of-way (ROW) on steep grades (slopes) with powerless vehicles propelled by moving cables attached to the vehicles and powered by engines or motors at a central location not onboard the vehicle. The special tramway types of vehicles have passenger seats that remain horizontal while the undercarriage (truck) is angled parallel to the slope.
Light Rail (LR),,"A transit mode that is typically an electric railway with a light volume traffic capacity compared to heavy rail (HR). It is characterized by: 
- Passenger rail cars operating singly (or in short, usually two car, trains) on fixed rails in shared or exclusive right-of-way (ROW)
